Introduction
------------

This mini-project represents a parser for Logo for Java using JavaCC. The parser was implemented during the module "Automata and formal languages".

Grammar				//modifictions we have done
-------

    Program    = "LOGO" Identifier { Subroutine } { Statement } "END"

    Subroutine = "TO" Identifier { Parameter } { Statement } "END"

    Statement  = "CS" | "PD" | "PU" | "HT" | "ST" 
               | "FD" NExpr | "BK" NExpr | "LT" NExpr | "RT" NExpr
               | "WAIT" NExpr
               | "REPEAT" NExpr "[" { Statement } "]"
               | "IF" BExpr "[" { Statement } "]"
               | "IFELSE" BExpr "[" { Statement } "]" "[" { Statement } "]"
               | Identifier { NExpr }

    NExpr      = NTerm { ( "+" | "-" )  NTerm }

    NTerm      = NFactor { ( "*" | "/" ) NFactor }

    NFactor    = "-" ( Number | REPCOUNT | Parameter | "(" NExpr ")" ) | 
           Number | REPCOUNT | Parameter | "(" NExpr ")" 

    BExpr      = BTerm { "OR" BTerm }

    BTerm      = BFactor { "AND" BFactor }

    BFactor    = "TRUE" | "FALSE" | "NOT" "(" BExpr ")" 
         | NExpr ( "==" | "!=" | "<" | ">" | "<=" | ">=" )  NExpr 

    Comments start with "#" with scope until the newline

    Numbers are real numbers

    Identifiers start with a letter followed by letters or digits

    Parameters are ":" followed by Identifier

    Identifiers, parameters, keywords in uppercase only


Solution
--------

    Solution: Description of your solution. How you have treated certain parts, in particular the translation of the REPCOUNT reserved identifier.
  

Test
----

We have created the pictures with the .logo files and "Microsoft Windows Logo".
We have created the pictures with the .java files and "Eclipse" with the "LogoPrimitives.class".
Then we have checked the generated pictures against each other and they're looking equally.


Limitations
-----------

The Direction of the Turtle in java is per default in the right direction whereas in logo is in the top direction.
